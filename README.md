Hello and welcome to the Tufts Virtual Compute Fest Study Group! This is a a group designed to bring together anyone from the Tufts community that is interested in learning more about using computational techniques for research. This group is open to all disciplines and skill levels. This community could split up into smaller interest groups depending on interest.

If you have any topics that you would like to discuss related to computing, data, metadata, writing code, or other related topics, please contact Kristin Lee, Research Data Librarian, at kristin.lee@tufts.edu.
